; Structure
(def sidhe 

  "A young man once a wand'ring went,
  He deemed he'd come of age,
  He severed every earthly tie,
  And curses his home a cage,
  
  His tracks, which trailed the setting sun,
  A thousand furlongs spanned,
  Pressed in clay and marked in mud,
  And printed on the sand,
  
  At last he reached the border peaks,
  With which the world is crowned,
  He sought a tarn to bathe his feet,
  And such a tarn he found,
  
  'The mountain cups his gnarlÃ©d hand,
  To pool the liquid sky,
  Some vain goddess's looking glass,
  Let fall and then let lie',
  
  So read his later vain attempts,
  To capture with his pen,
  A crystel well of wilderness,
  Transcending mortal ken,
  
  Yet as he stood in reverie,
  The nightfall stole around,
  Stars unsheathed above his head,
  And mist rose from the ground,
  
  And then, reflected in the tarn,
  The starlight coalesced,
  Our young man's ideal fantasy,
  Of loveliness, expressed,

  Her skin shone white as angel's robes, 
  Her hair swirled black as pitch, 
  Two shards of ice comprised her eyes,
  Two drops of blood - her lips.
  
  Yet as he bent to better see,
  His touch disturbed the water,
  Her face dissolved and left him only,  
  Faint and distant laughter.

  ***
  
  Now memory fades, unwanted thoughts,
  Disturb him in the dark,
  Was she merely fancy spun,
  To sooth a lonely heart?"
